    "### Our assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mode of transmission of the disease from person to person is through contact (\"contact transmission\") between a person who interacts with an infectious person. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Once a person comes into contact with the pathogen, there is a period of time (called the latency period) in which they are infected, but cannot infect others (yet!). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Population is not-constant (that is, people are born and die as time goes by).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A person in the population is either one of:\n",
    "    - <b>S</b>usceptible, i.e. not infected but not yet exposed, \n",
    "    - <b>E</b>xposed to the infection, i.e. exposed to the virus, but not yet infectious, \n",
    "    - <b>I</b>nfectious, and \n",
    "    - <b>R</b>ecovered from the infection. \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. People can die by \"natural causes\" during any of the stages. We assume an additional cause of death associated with the infectious stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Our flow diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "How does a person move from one stage into another? In other words, how does a person go from susceptible to exposed, to infected, to recovered? \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta$: Per-capita birth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu$: Per-capita natural death rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha$: Virus-induced average fatality rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta$: Probability of disease transmission per contact (dimensionless) times the number of contacts per unit time.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\epsilon$: Rate of progression from exposed to infectious (the reciprocal is the incubation period).\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\gamma$: Recovery rate of infectious individuals (the reciprocal is the infectious period).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\stackrel{\\Delta N} {\\longrightarrow} \\text{S} \\stackrel{\\beta\\frac{S}{N} I}{\\longrightarrow} \\text{E} \\stackrel{\\epsilon}{\\longrightarrow} \\text{I}  \\stackrel{\\gamma}{\\longrightarrow} \\text{R}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Our system of equations\n",
    "\n",
    "$N$ is updated at each time step, and infected peopel die at a higher rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ N = S + E + I + R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then express our model using differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\Delta N - \\beta \\frac{S}{N}I - \\mu S$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\beta \\frac{S}{N}I - (\\mu + \\epsilon )E$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\epsilon E - (\\gamma+ \\mu + \\alpha )I$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I - \\mu R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can keep track of the dead people, dead due to the infection. \n",
